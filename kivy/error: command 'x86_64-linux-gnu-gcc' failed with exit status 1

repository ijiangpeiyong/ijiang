error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1

I encountered the same problem in college having installed Linux Mint for the main project of my final year, the third solution below worked for me.

When encountering this error please note before the error it may say you are missing a package or header file, you should find those and install them and verify if it works. (e.g. ssl -> libssl)
